// [x]This application should have a form with five inputs that collect
// a new employee's first name, last name, ID number, job title, annual salary.

// When the "Submit" button is clicked:

// A new employee row should be added to the table.
// The footer's total monthly cost should be updated.
// The form inputs should be cleared out.
// If the total monthly cost exceeds $20,000, apply an over-budget CSS class
// to the footer element.

//  When applied, this CSS class should provide a clear visual indication that the 
// monthly cost has been exceeded. (This could be as simple as turning the footer text red.)

// Create a "Delete" button that removes an employee from the DOM.

// For base mode, the total monthly cost does not need to be updated when an employee is deleted.
